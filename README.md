# Cache Implementation using Max Heap and Linear Hash Table

## Description
Worked together with Giorgos Fotopoulos 

Having some testing files from our University, this program is an implementation of a cache that uses LRU and is consisted of two data structures.

### MAXHEAP:
O(1) entering a value when heap not full
O(logN) entering a value when heap not full

### Linear Hash Table:
O(1) entering a value when heap not full
(houever it need more memory space

### Overall Program:
O(logN): in any case 

### EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY

This project was an extra curricular activity.A teacher told us to do this project to test Hashing methods. Everyone participating would actually challenge all the other caches created by students.
(We were not graded for this project so it is possible that the code is not always well written)

This implementation was the faster no matter how many data were given for Testing
